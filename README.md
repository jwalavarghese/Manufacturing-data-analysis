**Project Overview:**/
This Project presents analysis of the Manufacturing data summarizing key performance indicators and providing insights and recommendations for future improvement. This project empowers strategic decision-making to remain competitive in the market landscape./
#Objectives:/
•	To analyse the overall production efficiency.
•	To identify and minimize rejected quantities. 
•	To assess the financial value generated.
•	To understand workload distribution. 
Key Findings:
•	Uneven workload distribution.
•	0.6% rejected quantity.
•	11.7% balance quantity.
Tools Used:
•	Excel
•	Tableau
Recommendations:
•	Implement advanced quality control techniques to reduce the rejected rate.
•	Optimize the manufacturing process to further increase production efficiency
•	Regularly reviewing and updating work order distributions.
Conclusions:
The data indicates high volume of quantity produced with significant financial value. The amount of rejected and balance quantities suggest space for improvement in that aspect. There is also an anomaly in the work distribution.
